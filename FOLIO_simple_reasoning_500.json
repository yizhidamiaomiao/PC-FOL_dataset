German is not identified as part of this family.\nInstead, German belongs to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, and not the Romance branch.\n\n4.Final Verdict: Because German does not belong to the Romance language family (even though it is related to Spanish through their shared Indo-European origins), the statement \"German is a Romance language\" is false.", "Math Expert Answer": "While German is related to Spanish (Premise 5), this does not imply that German is part of the Romance family, since premise 3 only shows all languages within a language family are related to each other, not the inversion.\n\nThe other premises do not explicitly or implicitly state that German belongs to the Romance language family.\n\nTherefore, the truth of the statement 'German is a Romance language.' is uncertain."}, {"Story id": 213, "Example id": 610, "If simple reasoning": true, "If case discussion": false, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "correct", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Goodcase"], "Conclusion": "French is an Indo-European language.", "Premises": ["All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.", "Romance languages are a language family.", "All languages within a language family are related to each other.", "French and Spanish are both Romance languages.", "German is related to Spanish.", "Basque is not related to any other language."], "Label": "True", "GPT-4o Answer": "The statement \"French is an Indo-European language\" is true based on the provided premises.

Otherwise, no artificial selection would be needed to replicate them.\n\nConclusion:\nThe statement 'Aurochs are extinct.' is true because:\n\nThe use of \"breeding back\" to recreate animals that resemble aurochs strongly implies that aurochs themselves are no longer alive.\nPremise 5 explicitly ties breeding back to extinct animals.", "Math Expert Answer": "Premise 2 states that Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs, and premise 3 states that Heck cattle are animals.\n\nAlthough premise 5 states that some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals, we do not know whether Heck cattle fall into the category of such animals or not, based solely on the given premises.\n\nPremise 1 shows the definition of breeding back, and premise 4 shows aurochs are animals, which are not related to the statement 'Aurochs are extinct'.\n\nTherefore, the truth of the statement 'Aurochs are extinct' is uncertain."}, {"Story id": 483, "Example id": 1310, "If simple reasoning": true, "If case discussion": false, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "correct", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Goodcase"], "Conclusion": "Vladimir is a Russian federation official.", "Premises": ["Everyone who can register to vote in the United States can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.", "If someone has United States citizenship, then they can register to vote in the United States.", "A person either has United States citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship.", "No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship.", "Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is a manager at Gazprom.", "Ekaterina she can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian federation official."], "Label": "Uncertain", "GPT-4o Answer": "To evaluate whether the statement \"Vladimir is a Russian Federation official\" is true or false, we'll carefully examine the relationships and logic based on the given premises.

Since Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship, this means:\nVladimir has United States citizenship.\n\nStep 3: Can Vladimir register to vote in the U.S.?\n\nFrom Premises (2) and (3), we know:\nIf Vladimir has United States citizenship, he can register to vote in the United States (Premise 2).\nIf he can register to vote, he can also participate in the 2024 presidential election (Premise 1).\n\nThus, Vladimir can register to vote and participate in the U.S. election.\n\nStep 4: Assessing whether Vladimir is a Russian Federation official\n\nFrom Premise (4):\nNo Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship.\n\nFrom Step 2, we deduced that Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship, so this condition doesn't directly rule him out as a Russian Federation official.\n\nHowever:\nPremise (5) directly provides two facts about Vladimir: he neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is a manager at Gazprom.\nNothing in the premises indicates that Vladimir holds a position as a Russian Federation official.

There is no overlap.\n\n4.No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship.\nRussian Federation officials cannot simultaneously hold Taiwanese citizenship. Therefore, any Russian Federation official must lack Taiwanese citizenship.\n\n5.Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is a manager at Gazprom.\nThis directly tells us that Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship and is not a manager at Gazprom.\n\n6.Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States, or she is a Russian Federation official.\nThis means that at least one of the following is true: (a) Ekaterina can register to vote in the U.S., or (b) Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official.\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning\nWe are tasked to assess whether the statement \"Vladimir is not a Russian Federation official\" is true or false. Let us carefully link the premises:\n\n1.From premise 5, Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship. From premise 3, we know that a person either has U.S. citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship. Since Vladimir lacks Taiwanese citizenship, he must have United States citizenship.\n\nConclusion: Vladimir has United States citizenship based on premises 3 and 5.\n\n2.From premise 2, anyone who has U.S. citizenship can register to vote in the United States. Since we concluded that Vladimir has United States citizenship, it follows that Vladimir can register to vote in the United States.\n\nConclusion: Vladimir can register to vote in the United States based on premises 2 and 5.\n\n3.From premise 1, we know that everyone who can register to vote in the U.S. can participate in the 2024 presidential election. Therefore, Vladimir can participate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nConclusion: Vladimir is eligible to participate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n4.Now consider premise 4, which states that no Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship. Although this does not directly involve Vladimir, we also know that Vladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship (from premise 5). However, this does not restrict him from being a Russian Federation official because premise 4 only guarantees that Russian Federation officials do not have Taiwanese citizenship, and we already confirmed that Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship.\n\n5.Finally, examine whether the possibility of Vladimir being a Russian Federation official conflicts with any premise.

Therefore, Yuri cannot be an American professional basketball player if he is not even a professional basketball player at all.\n\nThus, the conditional statement is false, because its \"then\" part (\"Yuri is an American professional basketball player\") is not true in any scenario considered here.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement \"If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player\" is false, because Yuri is not a professional basketball player at all, making the conclusion invalid.", "Math Expert Answer": "Premise 5 states that Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.\nThen, by premise 4 (If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.), Yuri does not leap straight into the air.\nBy premise 3 (If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.), Yuri cannot do jump shots.\nBy premise 2 (All professional basketball players can do jump shots.), Yuri is not a professional basketball player.\n\nThe statement we are evaluating is \"If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player\".\n\nWe have concluded that Yuri does not leap straight into the air, and Yuri is not a professional basketball player. \n\nBecause the antecedent \"If Yuri does not leap straight into the air\" is satisfied and the consequent \"then Yuri is an American professional basketball player\" is false, the conditional statement \"If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player\" is false."}, {"Story id": 456, "Example id": 1317, "If simple reasoning": true, "If case discussion": false, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "correct", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Goodcase"], "Conclusion": "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.", "Premises": ["Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.", "All professional basketball players can do jump shots.", "If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.", "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.", "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles."], "Label": "False", "GPT-4o Answer": "To determine whether the given statement is true or false, we carefully analyze the premises and the logical reasoning.

By extension, from premises 3 and 2, Yuri is unable to do jump shots. Since all professional basketball players can do jump shots, Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player.\n\nKey Inference:\nFrom premise 5 and the reasoning above, Yuri is not a professional basketball player, because to be a professional basketball player, one must be able to perform jump shots, which Yuri cannot do.\n\nAnalyzing the conditional statement:\n\n\"If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.\"\n\nThe statement can be analyzed as follows:\n\nThe antecedent: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player.\nIf Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, either:\nYuri is not a professional basketball player at all, or\nYuri is a professional basketball player but not an American.\n\nThe consequent: Yuri is a professional basketball player.\nWe already concluded earlier that Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player (because he cannot perform jump shots per the chain of logic in the premises).\n\nThus, if the antecedent holds (i.e., Yuri is not an American professional basketball player), the consequent (Yuri is a professional basketball player) does not follow.

Therefore, this premise establishes Steinhauer as the victor.\n\n2.Premise 2: \"Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\"\nThis is consistent with Premise 1 because a winner necessarily participates in the competition.

Therefore, Inception cannot be a folk song.\n\n4.Since the statement is an \"either/or\" claim, only one part needs to be true for the entire statement to hold.

Therefore, no such situation can exist without contradiction.\n\nConsequently, the statement is trivially true because the condition (that Bank of America cards can be used to transfer social payments in Russia while being usable with ApplePay) is impossible under the given premises, meaning there is no scenario where the antecedent is true. Therefore, the implication is vacuously true.", "Math Expert Answer": "The statement 'If Bank of America payment cards are international and can be used to transfer social payments in Russia, then they are international.' can be rewritten as 'If A is both B and C, then A is B'. Here, A represents the Bank of America payment card, B represents the category of international, and C represents the category of 'can be used to transfer social payments in Russia'.\n\nThus, from basic logic, the conditional statement 'If A is both B and C, then A is B' is always true. The reason is that, if A is both B and C, then A must be B; if A is not B or A is not C, then the statement is vacuously true. \n\nAs a result, the statement 'If Bank of America payment cards are international and can be used to transfer social payments in Russia, then they are international.' is true."}, {"Story id": 28, "Example id": 80, "If simple reasoning": true, "If case discussion": false, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "correct", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Goodcase"], "Conclusion": "Joe Rogan is American.", "Premises": ["Jason Kramer is an American music supervisor.", "Some American radio personalities are also music supervisors.", "Anyone who hosts a show on a public radio station is a radio personality.", "Joe Rogan is a radio personality.", "Jason Kramer hosted a show on a public radio station."], "Label": "Uncertain", "GPT-4o Answer": "The statement \"Joe Rogan is American\" cannot be determined as true or false based on the given premises.
