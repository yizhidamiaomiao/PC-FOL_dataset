This aligns with the first scenario for Bonnie in Premise 6.\n\nUsing Premise 4: Inactive and disinterested members chaperone high school dances.\n\nIf Bonnie were inactive and disinterested, this would require that:\nBonnie chaperones high school dances (Premise 4),\nBut by Premise 3, chaperones are not students who attend the school.

not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\nHypothesis (\"If Part\")\nBonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if not, she performs in school talent shows often.\n\nConclusion (\"Then Part\")\nBonnie is both:\n1.A young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and opportunities.\n2.An inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nStep-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.If Bonnie chaperones high school dances:\nBy P3, she cannot be a student (since chaperones are not students).\nBy P4, if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, she must chaperone dances.\nBy P6, if Bonnie is not a student, she cannot \"attend and be very engaged with school events.\"\nThis rules out her performing in school talent shows often (as per P1).\nIf Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she aligns with being inactive and disinterested and not a student.\n\n2.If Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances:\n\nBy the given hypothesis, Bonnie must perform in school talent shows often.\nBy P1, performing in talent shows means she attends and is very engaged with school events.\nBy P6, if she is engaged with school events, she is a student.\nThus, she cannot be inactive and disinterested in this case (contradicts being engaged).\nIf Bonnie does not chaperone, she is a student, engaged with school events, and not inactive/disinterested.\n\nTesting the \"Then Part\"\n\nThe conclusion requires Bonnie to be:\n1.A young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career.\n2.An inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\n1st condition (young child/teenager wishing to further academics):\nIf Bonnie is a young child/teenager wishing to further her academics, by P5, she must be a student.\nBonnie can only fulfill this if she does not chaperone (since chaperones are not students per P3).\n\n2nd condition (inactive and disinterested):\nIf Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, by P4, she must chaperone dances.\nHowever, if she chaperones, she cannot be a student or engaged with school events (as per P3, P1, and P6).\n\nConclusion\nThe statement is FALSE.\n\nReason:\n\nIf Bonnie chaperones, she cannot be a young child/teenager furthering academics (violates P5).\nIf Bonnie does not chaperone, she cannot be inactive/disinterested (violates P1 and P4 simultaneously).", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'If Bonnie either chaperones high

However, premise 6 says that managers can't work remotely.\nThus, if James is a manager, it follows that he cannot have lunch at home. Consequently, a manager must have lunch in the company.\n\n5.Combining the above deductions:\nSince James will appear in the company if and only if he is a manager (premise 7) and managers cannot work remotely (premise 6), if James is a manager, he must be physically in the company, and therefore he has lunch in the company.\n\n6.Final logical structure of the argument:\nIf James is a manager, then LunchAtCompany(James) is true.\nIf James is not a manager, then he is not in the company (premise 7), and he must therefore have lunch at home (premises 3 and 4).\n\nConclusion\nThe statement \"James has lunch in the company.\" is true, but only under the condition that James is a manager.

Zaha Hadid's designs:\nFrom Premise 1, all Zaha Hadid's design styles Max adores have interesting geometries.\n\nHowever, Premise 6 states that if a design style adored by Max has interesting geometries, then it must be:\nA brutalist building\nAnd evocative.\n\nBut Premise 2 tells us: no brutalist buildings Max adores have interesting geometries.\n\nTherefore, we have a contradictory situation if we assume Zaha Hadid's adored designs can exist:\nOn the one hand, Zaha Hadid's designs are supposed to have interesting geometries (Premise 1).\nBut on the other hand, any design with interesting geometries is required to be a brutalist building (Premise 6), which is logically ruled out (Premise 2).\n\nThis means Max cannot adore any of Zaha Hadid's design styles because it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\n3.

Evaluating the statement:\nThe statement claims: \"A design adored by Max is either evocative or dreamy.\"\n\nSince all Kelly Wearstler design styles adored by Max are both evocative and dreamy, the designs must be at least one of these (if not both).\n\nThus, the statement is true because all designs admired by Max must always satisfy \"evocative\" or \"dreamy.\"\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement \"A design adored by Max is either evocative or dreamy\" is true.", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'A design adored by Max is either evocative or dreamy', we need to analyze the status of the design adored by Max.\n\nFrom premise 3, every design style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. Hence, there are two cases.\n\nCase (a): A design style adored by Max is Zaha Hadid's design style, but not Kelly Wearstler's design style.\n\nIn this case, since the design style is adored by Max and is Zaha Hadid's design style, from premise 1 (All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.), it has interesting geometries.\nThen, according to premise 4 (No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.), since the design style has interesting geometries, it is not a brutalist building.\nSince the design style is adored by Max, and it has interesting geometries, then, by premise 6 (If a design style that Max adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.), it must be a brutalist building, which is inconsistent with premise 4.\n\nThus, the case (a) can not occur, which means that there is no design style adored by Max is Zaha Hadid's design style, but not Kelly Wearstler's design style.\n\nHence, from premise 3, all design styles that Max adores must not be Zaha Hadid's design style, and must be Kelly Wearstler's design style.\n\nThen, by premise 4 (All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.) and premise 5 (All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.), all design styles that Max adores are evocative and dreamy.\n\nNow consider the remaining two premises, premise 2 and premise 6.\nPremise 2 states that no brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.\nPremise 6 states that \"If a design style that Max adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative\".\n\nThus, if a design style that Max adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building, then by premise 2, it does not have interesting geometries, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, any design style that Max adores does not have interesting geometries.

Rule Out Contradictions:\nStep 4.1: Are Dried Thai Chilies \"Not Baked Sweets\"?\nAnything spicy cannot be a baked sweet (Premise 1).\nIf Dried Thai chilies are spicy (confirmed below), then they cannot be baked sweets.\nSo, Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets.\nThus, (c) holds true.\n\nStep 4.2: Are Dried Thai Chilies \"Spicy\"?\nDried Thai chilies are commonly considered spicy in real-world knowledge.\nPremise 5 allows for this possibility.\nThus, (a) holds true.\n\nStep 4.3: Are Dried Thai Chilies \"Mala Hotpots\"?\nFrom Premise 3, we know that all mala hotpots are spicy.\nWhile Dried Thai chilies are spicy (as established above), this alone is not enough to conclude they must be mala hotpots.\nMala hotpots are a distinct category, typically referring to a specific type of Chinese dish, while Dried Thai chilies are not naturally categorized this way.\nThus, (b) does not necessarily hold.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nGiven that Dried Thai chilies satisfy (a) and (c) but not (b), we conclude:\nThe statement \"Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot\" is FALSE.\n\nThis is because there is no evidence in the premises forcing Dried Thai chilies into the \"mala hotpot\" category, despite their spiciness.

Since Rock is Peter's pet (Premise 7), Rock must either be a monkey or a bird.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Rock's ability to breathe\nFrom Premise 5, all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.

Since Premise 1 requires someone who makes wedding plans to be engaged, and Premise 2 requires someone who invites others to ceremonies to make wedding plans, John cannot invite others to his ceremony if he is engaged.\nThus:\nIf John is engaged, he cannot invite others.\nIf John is not engaged, there's no restriction provided in the premises about inviting others. However, we don't know for certain if he would, so we'll have to keep this scenario open for now.\n\nStep 2: Can John have a larger family?\nLooking at Premise 6: If John has a larger family, then either:\nJohn has a well-attended wedding, or\nJohn invites friends to his ceremony.\nFrom Premise 3, if John has a well-attended wedding, he must invite others. But Premise 5 tells us that if John is engaged, he cannot invite others. Therefore:\nIf John has a larger family and is engaged, both consequences of larger family (well-attended wedding or inviting others) are blocked, which creates a contradiction.\n\nThus:\nJohn cannot be both engaged and have a larger family.\nIf John is not engaged, Premise 6 would still allow for him to have a larger family, but the statement to evaluate explicitly denies this possibility. Let's keep this under consideration.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the statement's components:\nThe statement we are evaluating says: \"John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding.\" This means BOTH of the following must be true:\n1.John does not have a larger family.\n2.John does not invite others to his wedding.\n\nWith what we've analyzed:\nIf John is engaged, Premise 5 forbids him from inviting others, and Premise 6 prevents him from having a larger family. This directly supports the statement.\nIf John is not engaged, there's no specific restriction in Premises 1-6 that prevents him from inviting others or having a larger family (Premise 6 becomes relevant), so the statement could be false in this scenario.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe truth of the statement depends on whether John is engaged:\nIf John is engaged, the statement is true, because he cannot invite others (Premise 5) and cannot have a larger family without causing a contradiction (Premise 6).\nIf John is not engaged, the statement is false, because there's no restriction that prevents him from having a larger family or inviting others.\n\nThus, without knowing whether John is actually engaged, we cannot definitively declare the statement to be true or false. However, based on the logical structure, if John is engaged (which the premises seem to strongly suggest), the statement is true.", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding', let's try to discuss the two possible cases \"John is engaged\" and \"John is not engaged\" separately.\n\nCase 1: If John is engaged.\n\nBy premise 5 \"If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans\", John does not invite friends to their ceremony and John does not make wedding plans.\nPremise 2 states that all people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. Since John does not make wedding plans, John does not invite others to come to their ceremony, which is consistent with premise 5.\nThen, by premise 3 (Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.), John does not have a well-attended wedding.\nSince John does not have a well-attended wedding and does not invite others to come to their ceremony, by premise 6 (If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.), John does not have a larger family.\n\nWe do not need to consider premise 4 (Some people who have well-attended weddings have larger families.) because no premises show if John falls into the category of the people in premise 4.\n\nHence, this case can exist.\nIn this case, John does not have a larger family, and John does not have a well-attended wedding. Therefore, the statement 'John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding' is true in case 1.\n\nCase 2: If John is not engaged.\n\nBy premise 1 (All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.), since John is not engaged, John does not make wedding plans.\nPremise 2 states that all people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans. Since John does not make wedding plans, John does not invite others to come to their ceremony.\nThen, by premise 3 (Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.), John does not have a well-attended wedding.\nSince John does not have a well-attended wedding and does not invite others to come to their ceremony, by premise 6 (If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.), John does not have a larger family.\n\nThus, this case can exist too.\nIn this case, John does not have a larger family, and John does not have a well-attended wedding. Therefore, the statement 'John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding' is true in case 2.\n\nNow we find that both of the cases can exist, and in both two cases, the statement is true. Hence, we can conclude that the statement is always true."}, {"Story id": 460, "Example id": 1327, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": true, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "wrong", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Goodcase"], "Conclusion": "\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is rated General Audience.", "Premises": ["If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.", "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.", "If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.", "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.", "All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.", "\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a film.", "\"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages."], "Label": "Uncertain", "GPT-4o Answer": "We are tasked with determining whether the statement \"'Hachi: A Dog's Tale' is rated General Audience\" is true or false given the premises provided.

What do we know about Vladimir?\n\nFrom premise (5), Vladimir satisfies two specific conditions:\nVladimir does not hold Taiwanese citizenship.\nVladimir is not a manager at Gazprom.\n\nSo, the second part of the statement, \"Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom,\" is false.\n\nThus, the truth of the overall statement depends entirely on the first part: whether \"Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\"\n\n2. Can Ekaterina participate in the 2024 United States presidential election?\n\nFor Ekaterina to participate in the election, based on premise (1), she must be able to register to vote in the United States.\n\nFrom premise (6), we know:\n\"Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States or she is a Russian Federation official.\"\n\nThis means there are two possibilities:\nIf Ekaterina can register to vote, then she can participate in the election (based on premise 1).\nIf Ekaterina is a Russian Federation official, then she cannot have Taiwanese citizenship (by premise 4), but nothing in the premises tells us definitively whether she can or cannot register to vote in the United States.\n\n3. Does Ekaterina have United States citizenship?\n\nLet's consider what we know about citizenship:\nFrom premise (3), a person must have either US citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship (but not both).\nIf Ekaterina has US citizenship, then she can register to vote (by premise 2) and therefore participate in the election (by premise 1).\n\nIf Ekaterina does NOT have US citizenship, then she must have Taiwanese citizenship (by premise 3). However, if she is a Russian Federation official (as implied in the second possibility of premise 6), then premise (4) states that she cannot hold Taiwanese citizenship - creating a contradiction unless Ekaterina has US citizenship.\n\nThis suggests that Ekaterina must have US citizenship in order to satisfy all premises without contradiction. Therefore, Ekaterina can register to vote and can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.\n\n4.

So, we can't assume KiKi is a dog solely based on the premises.\n\nStep 2: Check if KiKi barks.\nKiKi barks if and only if it is a dog (according to premise 2). But there is no evidence in the premises to confirm this.\n\nStep 3: Determine KiKi's jumping behavior.\nFrom premise 4 (\"if an animal has legs, then it jumps\"), we know an animal without legs does not jump. However:\nIf KiKi has legs, it must also jump.\nNo explicit statement confirms whether KiKi has or lacks legs.\n\nStep 4: Explore KiKi being terricolous.\nFrom premise 5 (\"if an animal is terricolous, it has legs\"), we can infer:\nAny terricolous animal must have legs, which means it jumps (from premise 4).\nIf KiKi does not jump, it cannot be terricolous.\n\nStep 5: Analyze Jane's preferences.\nFrom premises 1 and 3:\nIf KiKi jumps, Jane must like it, because Jane likes all animals that jump.\nIf KiKi barks, Jane does not like it, because Jane dislikes any animal that barks.\n\nEvaluating the Statement: \"KiKi is a barking dog.\"\n\n1.If KiKi is a barking dog, it:\nMust be both a dog (per premise 2) and bark.\nMust have legs (all dogs have legs).\nMust jump (from premise 4, since it has legs).\n\n2.However, from premise 3, Jane likes all animals that jump, and from premise 1, Jane dislikes all animals that bark. This creates a contradiction if KiKi is both jumping (liked by Jane) and barking (disliked by Jane).\n\n3.There is no explicit evidence in the premises to confirm that KiKi is a dog, nor that it barks.\n\nConclusion:\nThe statement \"KiKi is a barking dog\" is false, because:\n\nThere is no direct evidence to confirm that KiKi is a dog (and thus barks).\nEven if KiKi were a barking dog, it would lead to a logical contradiction in Jane's preferences (which cannot simultaneously hold).", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'KiKi is a barking dog.', let's discuss the status of KiKi.\n\nPremise 7 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. \nSince the antecedent shows that KiKi does not have legs, we can simplify this premise as \"if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous\".\n\nPremise 5 states that \"if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\" and premise 6 tells us that KiKi is an animal. Hence, if KiKi is terricolous, then it has legs.\n\nThus, the antecedent of premise 7 can not be satisfied. The reason is that, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous (premise 7), then by premise 5 and premise 6, it has legs, which is a contradiction to 'KiKi neither jumps nor has legs'.\n\nTherefore, KiKi jumps or has legs.\n\nBecause premise 4 tells us that if an animal has legs then it jumps, we can conclude that KiKi always can jump.\nThen, by premise 3 (Jane likes all animals that jump.), since KiKi jumps and is an animal (premise 6), Jane likes KiKi.\nBy premise 1 (Jane does not like any animals that bark.), KiKi can not bark.\nBy premise 2 (All dogs are animals that bark.), KiKi is not a dog.\n\nAs a result, the statement 'KiKi is a barking dog' is false."}, {"Story id": 459, "Example id": 1326, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": true, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Goodcase"], "Conclusion": "KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.", "Premises": ["Jane does not like any animals that bark.", "All dogs are animals that bark.", "Jane likes all animals that jump.", "If an animal has legs, then it jumps.", "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.", "KiKi is an animal.", "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs."], "Label": "True", "GPT-4o Answer": "To evaluate whether the statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is true or false, given the premises, let us carefully analyze the information step by step.\n\nPremises Recap and Logical Breakdowns:\n\n1.Jane does not like any animals that bark.\nIf an animal barks, Jane does not like it.\n\n2.All dogs are animals that bark.\nAll dogs necessarily bark.\n\n3.Jane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal jumps, Jane likes it.\n\n4.If an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nLegs $\\rightarrow$ Jumps (if an animal has legs, it can jump).\n\n5.If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\nTerricolous $\\rightarrow$ Legs (if an animal lives on land, it must have legs).\n\n6.KiKi is an animal.\n\n7.If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\nThis is a redundant statement since a situation where KiKi \"neither jumps nor has legs\" already implies something that cannot logically occur (contradictory with other premises, as we'll see).\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Does KiKi bark?\nTo understand whether KiKi barks, let's use the relevant premises:\nFrom premises 2, all dogs bark.\nIf KiKi were to bark, then by premise 1, Jane would not like KiKi.\nTo figure out if Jane likes KiKi, we turn to premise 3.\nPremise 3 says Jane likes all animals that jump. To see if KiKi jumps, examine if KiKi has legs, which we do next.\n\nStep 2: Does KiKi have legs?\nFrom premise 5, if an animal is terricolous (land-living), then it has legs. Premise 4 implies that if KiKi has legs, then KiKi must jump.\nPremises 4 and 5 therefore guarantee that KiKi must have legs (since it's an animal, and animals either live on land or another condition must hold).\nTherefore, KiKi has legs and also jumps.\n\nStep 3: Does Jane like KiKi?\nSince KiKi jumps (as established above), premise 3 implies Jane likes KiKi.\n\nStep 4: Is KiKi a dog? Does KiKi bark?\nIf KiKi were a dog, then premise 2 tells us KiKi would necessarily bark.\nBut from premise 1, Jane does not like animals that bark.\nSince we established that Jane likes KiKi, it follows that KiKi cannot bark and therefore cannot be a dog.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe statement \"KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog\" is TRUE, because:\n\nKiKi does not bark (otherwise Jane would not like KiKi, per premise 1).\nKiKi is not a dog (because all dogs bark, per premise 2).", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog', let's discuss the status of KiKi.\n\nPremise 7 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. \nSince the antecedent shows that KiKi does not have legs, we can simplify this premise as \"if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous\".\n\nPremise 5 states that \"if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\" and premise 6 tells us that KiKi is an animal.

(This doesn't directly apply to Thomas unless we know if he goes to the spa frequently. However, it sets a general rule about being not miserly.)\n\nPremise 2: People who work at Jess's company are either miserly and need to save a large portion of their income or frivolously spend a lot of money. (This establishes that anyone at Jess's company falls into one of these two categories.)\n\nPremise 3: If people who work at Jess's company frivolously spend a lot of money, then they value quality manufacturing and luxury items. (This means that if Thomas frivolously spends a lot of money, he must value quality and luxury items.)\n\nPremise 4: If people who work at Jess's company value quality manufacturing and luxury items, then they enjoy shopping for materialistic items in their free time.

(This one gives a conditional aspect relating to miserly behavior and valuing luxury.)\n\nPremise 7: Thomas values quality manufacturing and luxury items or he is not miserly. (Clarifies that either he values luxury, or he is not miserly. Not being miserly doesn't specifically mean he spends frivolously.)\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know Thomas must either be mainly focused on saving money (miserly) or frivolously spending a lot of money.\n\nNow, let's use Premise 7: If Thomas is miserly, he must value quality manufacturing and luxury items.

However:\nIf ( $\\neg E \\land \\neg$ C ) (the watch is neither edible nor clothes), it would contradict Premise 3.\n\nThis apparent contradiction suggests that one of the premises leads to an impossible scenario.

Therefore, R is true.\n\nNow consider the conclusion we are trying to validate: $\\neg$Q$\\lor$R (Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is a big fan of pop bands and singers).\n\nSince we already established Q is true and R is true, $\\neg$Q$\\lor$R simplifies to R, which is true because R is true.\n\nConclusion:\nThe statement \"If Sam is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is a big fan of pop bands and singers\" is TRUE based on the given premises.

Now let's consider if Sam can have high ambitions and future career goals.\n\nCase 1: Sam has high ambitions and future career goals.\n\nIn this case, since Sam has high ambitions and future career goals, by premise 5, Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.\nPremise 3 states that \"If people are big fans of pop bands and singers, then they have a lot of music decorations in their room.\" Because Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers, Sam has a lot of music decorations in their room.\nThen, by premise 1 (\"If people have a lot of music decorations in their rooms, they cannot pack and move out of their rooms very easily.\"), Sam can not pack and move out of their rooms very easily.\n\nHowever, from premise 2 (\"If people have high ambitions and future career goals, then they can pack and move out of their rooms very easily.\"), since Sam has high ambitions and future career goals, Sam can pack and move out of their rooms very easily.

For the consequent, it is still unknown whether Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers or not, since in case 2, Sam both is a big fan and is not a big fan are consistent with the given premises.\n\nAs a result, the truth of the statement \"If Sam is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is a big fan of pop bands and singers\" is uncertain."}, {"Story id": 333, "Example id": 870, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "correct", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": ["Badcase", "Badcase must modify the mathematical symbol"], "Conclusion": "If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals and is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is not a young teenage girl attending college.", "Premises": ["If people have a lot of music decorations in their rooms, they cannot pack and move out of their rooms very easily.", "If people have high ambitions and future career goals, then they can pack and move out of their rooms very easily.", "If people are big fans of pop bands and singers, then they have a lot of music decorations in their room.", "All young teenage girls who attend music festival frequently have high ambitions and future career goals.", "If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals, then Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers."], "Label": "True", "GPT-4o Answer": "To determine the truth of the statement in question, we need to carefully analyze the logical relationships outlined in the premises.\n\nPremises Recap:\n1.If people have a lot of music decorations in their rooms, they cannot pack and move out of their rooms very easily.\n(Music decorations $\\rightarrow$ Cannot move easily)\n\n2.If people have high ambitions and future career goals, then they can pack and move out of their rooms very easily.\n(High ambitions $\\rightarrow$ Can move easily)\n\n3.If people are big fans of pop bands and singers, then they have a lot of music decorations in their rooms.\n(Fans of pop $\\rightarrow$ Music decorations)\n\n4.All young teenage girls who attend music festivals frequently have high ambitions and future career goals.\n(Young teenage girl + Attends music festivals $\\rightarrow$ High ambitions)\n\n5.If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals, then Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.\n(Sam: High ambitions $\\rightarrow$ Sam: Pop fan)\n\nStatement to Analyze:\n\"If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals and is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is not a young teenage girl attending college.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify key parts of the statement.\nThe statement needs further clarification:\nAssumption: Sam is a young teenage girl attending college with high ambitions and career goals.\nDesired conclusion: Sam either does not have high ambitions, or is not a young teenage girl attending college.\nTo determine if this assertion is true, we will evaluate how the premises lead to logical implications.\n\nStep 2: Deduction from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 4:\nIf Sam is a young teenage girl who attends music festivals frequently, it automatically follows that she has high ambitions and career goals.\nAssumption: Attending college might imply that Sam satisfies the \"young teenage girl with high ambitions\" description.\n\nFrom premise 5:\nIf Sam has high ambitions (from premise 4), then Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers.\n\nFrom premise 3:\nIf Sam is a fan of pop bands and singers, then Sam has a lot of music decorations in her room.\n\nFrom premise 1:\nIf Sam has many music decorations in her room, Sam cannot pack and move out of her room easily.\n\nFrom premise 2:\nBut if Sam has high ambitions and career goals, Sam can pack and move out of her room easily.\n\nContradiction:\nPremises 1 and 2 create a conflict. If Sam has high ambitions, she should be able to move out of her room easily. But being a fan of pop bands (which follows from high ambitions) leads to having music decorations, which makes moving out difficult. This is a direct logical contradiction.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the Statement.\nThe statement asserts:\n\"If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals and is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions or is not a young teenage girl attending college.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\nAssume Sam does meet all the conditions (has high ambitions, is a young teenage girl, attends college).\nFrom the premises, this leads to contradictory conclusions:\nSam can move out easily due to her high ambitions (premise 2).\nSam cannot move out easily due to her pop fandom and music decorations (premises 3 and 1).\n\nThis contradiction implies that the original assumption (Sam meets all conditions) cannot logically hold. For the statement to avoid contradictions, Sam must fail at least one of these conditions:\n\nSam does not actually have high ambitions (which might break the chain of contradictions).\nSam is not a young teenage girl attending college.\n\nTherefore:\nThe statement is true, because it correctly reflects the logical impossibility of Sam satisfying all conditions simultaneously. This forces one of the conditions to fail, making the \"either-or\" conclusion valid.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement is true because the premises lead to a logical contradiction if Sam satisfies all conditions, forcing at least one condition to be false.", "Math Expert Answer": "To analyze the statement \"If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals and is a young teenage girl attending college, then Sam either does not have high ambitions and future career goals or is not a young teenage girl attending college.\", we start by analyzing the status of Sam.\n\nThe premise mentioned that Sam is premise 5, which states that \"If Sam has high ambitions and future career goals, then Sam is a big fan of pop bands and singers\".

Hence, two cases need to be discussed.\n\nCase (a): Marvin from both Earth and Mars.\n\nIn this case, since Marvin from Mars, by premise 2 (If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.), Marvin is an alien. \nThen, by premise 1 (All aliens are extraterrestrials.), Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\nSince premise 3 states that no extraterrestrials are human, Marvin is not a human.\nPremise 4 states that all highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. Because Marvin from Earth and is not a human, Marvin can not be a highly intelligent being.\nHowever, premise 5 states that Marvin is a highly intelligent being, which conflicts with the consequent of premise 4.\n\nTherefore, since there is a contradiction, case (a) is impossible to occur.\n\nCase (b): Marvin from neither Earth nor Mars.\n\nIn this case, since Marvin is not from Earth, by premise 7 (If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.), Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\nSince premise 3 states that no extraterrestrials are human, Marvin is not a human.\nFrom premise 5, Marvin is a highly intelligent being. \n\nThen we analyze the remaining premises.\nPremise 1 states that all aliens are extraterrestrials. Although Marvin is an extraterrestrial, we do not know whether Marvin is an alien or not based solely on this premise.\nPremise 2 states that if someone is from Mars, then they are an alien. Since Marvin is not from Mars, this premise is compatible with case (b).\nPremise 4 states that all highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. Since Marvin is not from Earth, this premise is compatible with case (b).\n\nTherefore, all the given premises are consistent with the assumption of case (b). Hence, case (b) can occur.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, we know that case (a) can not exist. Therefore, only case (b) holds, which means that Marvin must from neither Earth nor Mars.\nThen, from the analysis of case (b), Marvin is an extraterrestrial, but we do not know whether Marvin is an alien or not.\n\nAs a result, the truth of the statement \"If Marvin is an extraterrestrial, then Marvin is an alien\" is uncertain."}, {"Story id": 340, "Example id": 10004, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "wrong", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": [], "Conclusion": "Djokovic lives in a tax haven and Djokovic is an athlete.", "Premises": ["Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.", "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.", "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.", "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.", "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.", "If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.", "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.", "Djokovic is at the mixer, and if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid."], "Label": "Uncertain", "GPT-4o Answer": "To determine whether the statement \"Djokovic lives in a tax haven and Djokovic is an athlete\" is true, false, or uncertain, let's analyze the given premises step by step and examine their logical consequences.\n\nPremises Recap:\n1.Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\n2.Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.\n3.All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.\n4.All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.\n5.If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.\n6.If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.\n7.All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.\n8.Djokovic is at the mixer, and if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well paid.\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.Djokovic is at the mixer: Premise 8 explicitly states Djokovic is present. Based on Premise 1, this means Djokovic must either be a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n2.Is Djokovic a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor? Given that Djokovic is a well-known professional tennis player in real life, it is safe to assume Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. Further, by Premise 2, this means Djokovic is a professional tennis player. Thus, Djokovic is not an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n3.Is Djokovic an athlete? By Premise 4, all professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes. Since Djokovic is a professional tennis player, Djokovic is also an athlete.\n\n4.Is Djokovic famous? By Premise 6, all athletes at the mixer are famous. Since Djokovic is an athlete (as established above), Djokovic is also famous.\n\n5.If Djokovic is famous, is Djokovic well-paid? Premise 8 explicitly states that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. Since Djokovic is both famous and an athlete, it follows that Djokovic is well-paid.\n\n6.Does Djokovic live in a tax haven? By Premise 7, all well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. Since Djokovic is well-paid (as established above), Djokovic must live in a tax haven.\n\nFinal Assessment of the Statement:\nDjokovic is an athlete (established in steps 2 and 3).\nDjokovic lives in a tax haven (established in step 6).\nThus, the statement \"Djokovic lives in a tax haven and Djokovic is an athlete\" is TRUE.\n\nWhy Is It True?\nThe logical flow of the premises directly supports the conclusion. Djokovic being a professional tennis player connects him to being an athlete, which links to being famous, then well-paid, and finally living in a tax haven.

Hence, since Djokovic is at the mixer, Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. Therefore, we need to discuss two cases.\n\nCase 1: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\nIn this case, since Djokovic is at the mixer and is a Grand Slam champion, by premise 2 (Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.), Djokovic is a professional tennis player.\nThen, by premise 4 (All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.), Djokovic is an athlete.\nBy premise 6 (If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.), since Djokovic at the mixer and is an athlete, Djokovic is famous.\nPremise 8 also shows that if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.

In this case, Djokovic lives in a tax haven, and Djokovic is an athlete.\n\nCase 2: Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor. \n\nIn this case, since Djokovic is at the mixer and is an Oscar-nominated actor, by premise 3 (All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.), Djokovic is a celebrity.\nThen, by premise 5 (If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.), since Djokovic is at the mixer and a celebrity, Djokovic is well paid.\nThen, by premise 7 (All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.), Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nThe other premises (premise 2,4,6) are consistent with the previous clauses.\n\nTherefore, case 2 is possible to exist, also. In this case, Djokovic lives in a tax haven, but we do not know whether Djokovic is an athlete or not.\n\nPutting the two cases together, we can find that in both cases, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.

According to Premise 1, children could then watch it without guidance. However, a family-friendly animated film cannot contain excessive erotic or violent content. This means this scenario is incompatible with the condition in the statement (\"Hachi contains excessive erotic and violent content\").\n\nIf \"Hachi\" is appropriate for people of all ages:\nBy Premises 1 and 3, children could watch it without guidance. Again, a film appropriate for all ages cannot contain excessive erotic or violent content. This scenario is also incompatible with the condition in the statement.\n\nIn either case, \"Hachi\" cannot simultaneously be a film that contains excessive erotic/violent content and be either family-friendly or appropriate for all ages. Thus, the antecedent of the conditional statement is likely false, rendering the conditional statement itself vacuously true. However, this is irrelevant since Premise 2 already states the opposite conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Verify consistency with Premise 2:\nSince Premise 2 explicitly establishes that films with excessive erotic/violent content cannot be watched by children without guidance, this directly invalidates the truth of the statement being evaluated. Premise 2 dominates here because it clashes with the conclusion of the evaluated statement.\n\nConclusion\nThe statement \"If 'Hachi: A Dog's Tale' contains excessive erotic and violent content, then children can watch it without guidance from their parents\" is FALSE, because it contradicts Premise 2, which unequivocally states that no film with excessive erotic/violent content can be watched by children without guidance.", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 6, \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is a film. \n\nFrom premise 7, we know that \"Hachi: A dog's Tale\" is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.

At first glance, this makes the statement of interest false based on P5.\n\n2.To confirm, we need to check if there is any logical inconsistency or exception caused by Taylor's specific case (P6).\n\nStep 3: How does P6 affect the analysis?\nPremise 6 provides the following two exclusive possibilities for Taylor:\n\n1.Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being.\nIf she grew up in a health-conscious home, then by P2, Taylor eats salads regularly.\nIf Taylor eats salads regularly, then by P1, she is conscious about her health.\nThis creates a contradiction with the idea that Taylor disregards her physical well-being (from P4, disregarding physical well-being implies not being health-conscious).\nTherefore, this first scenario cannot logically occur.\n\n2.Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and does not disregard her physical well-being.\nIf she did not grow up in a health-conscious home, then by P3, Taylor does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.\nHowever, this does not conflict with P5 because P5 only states that if Taylor visits the gym, she fulfills her nutritional intake. It does not require gym attendance.\nThus, this second scenario is consistent.\n\nFrom P6, the only possible configuration for Taylor is that she did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her physical well-being.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the truth of the conditional statement\n\n1.From the analysis of P5, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she fulfills her daily nutritional intake (this is universally true for anyone, including Taylor).\nThe statement of interest contradicts this premise, as it claims Taylor \"can not\" fulfill her nutritional intake in this scenario.\n\n2.Regardless of Taylor's specific situation (from P6), P5 applies to any person who visits the gym regularly, meaning Taylor would fulfill her nutritional intake if she attended the gym daily.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe statement \"If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, Taylor can not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes\" is FALSE, because it directly contradicts the universal premise in P5.", "Math Expert Answer": "We want to know if the statement \"If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, Taylor can not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes\" is true or false. Hence, we need to analyze the status of Taylor.\n\nPremise 6 states that Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither. Thus, there are two cases for Taylor.\n\nCase 1: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being.\n\nBy premise 2 (All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.), since Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, Taylor eats salads regularly.\nThen, by premise 1 (All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.), Taylor is very conscious about her health and eating habits.\n\nSince Taylor disregards her physical well-being, by premise 4 (All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.), Taylor is not very conscious about her health and eating habits. This is a contradiction with the previous analysis that Taylor is very conscious about her health and eating habits.\n\nThus, Case 1 is inconsistent, so it cannot apply to Taylor.\n\nCase 2: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor disregards her physical well-being.\n\nBy premise 3 (All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.), since Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, Taylor can not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes.\nThen, by premise 5 (If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.), Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nThe other premises (1,2,4) are consistent with the analysis in case 2.\n\nSince case 1 is inconsistent, only case 2 exists. \nHence, Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor disregards her physical well-being.\nBesides, by premises 3 and 5, Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the conditional statement 'If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day' is not satisfied.\n\nAs a result, the conditional statement \"If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, Taylor can not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes\" is vacuously true."}, {"Story id": 459, "Example id": 10018, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": true, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": [], "Conclusion": "If KiKi can bark, then Jane can bark.", "Premises": ["Jane does not like any animals that bark.", "All dogs are animals that bark.", "Jane likes all animals that jump.", "If an animal has legs, then it jumps.", "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.", "KiKi is an animal.", "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs."], "Label": "True", "GPT-4o Answer": "To evaluate whether the statement \"If KiKi can bark, then Jane can bark\" is true, false, or uncertain, we will analyze the logical consequences of the given premises step by step:\n\nGiven:\nJane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nStep-by-step Analysis:\n1. Categorizing animals that bark, jump, or have legs:\nPremise 2 says all dogs are animals that bark, implying if something is barking, it behaves like a dog (or similar animals that bark).\nPremise 4 says all animals with legs jump, meaning that any animal that has legs is also capable of jumping.\nPremise 5 says if an animal is terricolous (living on the ground), it automatically has legs.\n\n2. Jane's preferences:\nPremise 1: Jane does not like animals that bark.\nPremise 3: Jane explicitly likes all animals that jump.\nBy Premise 4, any animal that has legs jumps, so Jane likes all animals with legs (because they jump).\n\n3. Reasoning about KiKi:\nPremise 6 states KiKi is an animal, and we don't yet know whether KiKi barks, has legs, or jumps.\nPremise 7 gives a conditional: if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\nIf KiKi is terricolous by Premise 5, it must have legs, and by Premise 4, it must jump.\nSo KiKi must at least have legs and jump (and is thus liked by Jane, based on Premise 3).\nThis means KiKi either jumps or has legs or is terricolous, but in any case, KiKi will eventually meet the conditions for jumping.\n\n4. Can KiKi bark?\nIf KiKi can bark, by Premise 1, Jane will not like KiKi because Jane does not like any animals that bark.\n\n5. Evaluating the statement \"If KiKi can bark, then Jane can bark\":\n\nNow we consider the logical connection between KiKi barking and Jane barking.\nThere is no premise indicating that Jane's ability to bark is connected to her preferences or to KiKi's capabilities. Jane's preferences for or against certain animals offer no evidence about her own physical traits or abilities.\nWhether KiKi barks or not has no implication for Jane's ability to bark. Therefore, the antecedent (\"If KiKi can bark\") provides no information about Jane's ability, and the consequent (\"Jane can bark\") cannot be determined from the premises.\n\nConclusion:\nThe truth value of the statement \"If KiKi can bark, then Jane can bark\" is UNCERTAIN. There is no information in the premises to establish whether Jane herself can or cannot bark.", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'If KiKi can bark, then Jane can bark.', let's discuss about the status of KiKi.\n\nPremise 7 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. \nSince the antecedent shows that KiKi does not has legs, we can simplify this premise as \"if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous\".\n\nPremise 5 states that \"if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\" and premise 6 tells us that KiKi is an animal. Hence, if KiKi is terricolous, then it has legs.\n\nThus, the antecedent of premise 7 can not be satisfied. The reason is that, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous (premise 7), then by premise 5 and premise 6, it has legs, which is a contradiction to 'KiKi neither jumps nor has legs'.\n\nTherefore, KiKi jumps or has legs.\n\nBecause premise 4 tells us that if an animal has legs then it jumps, we can conclude that KiKi always can jump.\nThen, by premise 3 (Jane likes all animals that jump.), since KiKi jumps and is an animal (premise 6), Jane likes KiKi.\nBy premise 1 (Jane does not like any animals that bark.), KiKi can not bark.\nBy premise 2 (All dogs are animals that bark.), KiKi is not a dog.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the conditional statement 'If KiKi can bark' can not be satisfied, since KiKi can not bark.\n\nAs a result, the statement 'If KiKi can bark, then Jane can bark' is vacuously true."}, {"Story id": 463, "Example id": 10019, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": true, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "correct", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": [], "Conclusion": "If the sea eel is a plant and is not bacteria, then it is bacteria.", "Premises": ["All eels are fish.", "No fish are plants.", "Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal.", "All multicellular animals are not bacteria.", "All animals displayed in the collection are multicellular.", "A sea eel is displayed in the collection.", "The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant."], "Label": "True", "GPT-4o Answer": "To determine whether the statement \"If the sea eel is a plant and is not bacteria, then it is bacteria\" is true, false, or uncertain, we will evaluate it logically within the context of the premises provided.\n\nRestating the Given Premises:\n\n1.All eels are fish.\nEvery eel is categorized as a fish.\n\n2.No fish are plants.\nIt is impossible for any fish to also be a plant.\n\n3.Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal.\nThere is no third category; every item displayed must fall into one of these two groups.\n\n4.All multicellular animals are not bacteria.\nMulticellular animals cannot be classified as bacteria.\n\n5.All animals displayed in the collection are multicellular.\nThere are no non-multicellular animals in the collection.\n\n6.A sea eel is displayed in the collection.\nThe sea eel is part of the displayed collection.\n\n7.The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant.\nThe sea eel must satisfy at least one of these conditions: (a) it is an eel, or (b) it is an animal, or (c) it is not a plant.\n\nAnalyzing the Statement:\nStatement: \"If the sea eel is a plant and is not bacteria, then it is bacteria.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement.

this systematically, we will carefully synthesize the implications from the premises.\n\nKey Information from the Premises\n\nPremise 1:\nAll of Michael's neighbors who grow their own fresh vegetables in their home gardens also have ample space.\nIf Peter grows his own vegetables, then Peter has ample space.\n\nPremise 2:\nAll of Michael's neighbors who are young working professionals and live in large cities do not have ample space.\nYoung working professionals living in large cities cannot have ample space.\n\nPremise 3:\nAll of Michael's neighbors who order takeout from delivery services often grow their own fresh vegetables in their home garden.\nIf Peter orders takeout often, then Peter grows his own vegetables, meaning he also has ample space (by Premise 1).\n\nPremise 4:\nAll of Michael's neighbors who enjoy going out often to restaurants with friends order takeout from delivery services often.\nIf Peter enjoys going out often, then Peter orders takeout often.\nBy Premise 3, this implies that Peter grows his own vegetables and has ample space.\n\nPremise 5:\nAll of Michael's neighbors who regularly tout the benefits of homegrown and homecooked meals over fast food enjoy going out often to restaurants with friends.\nIf Peter touts the benefits of homegrown meals, then Peter enjoys going out often.\nBy Premise 4, this implies Peter orders takeout often, which in turn (from Premise 3 and 1) implies that Peter grows his own vegetables and has ample space.\n\nPremise 6:\nPeter, Michael's neighbor, grows his own fresh vegetables in his home garden, or regularly touts the benefits of homegrown and homecooked meals over fast food, or both.\nPeter must meet at least one of these conditions:\n(a) Peter grows vegetables,\n(b) Peter touts homegrown/homecooked meals,\nor

Peter touts benefits, he grows vegetables and has ample space.\nIn both cases, Peter has ample space and therefore cannot be a young working professional living in a large city (Premise 2).\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement \"Peter either grows his own fresh vegetables in his home garden or is a young working professional who lives in large cities\" is false.\n\nReason:\n\nPeter grows his own

To evaluate its truth:\nWe start with the antecedent: \"Ryan is capable of attracting audiences.\"\nThen analyze the consequent: \"Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra.\"\nIf every case when the antecedent is true also results in the consequent being true, the statement is true. However, if there is a situation where Ryan is capable of attracting audiences but does not have a temporary role, the statement would be false.\n\nStep-by-Step Analysis:\n\nStep 1: What does it mean for Ryan to \"be capable of attracting audiences\"?\nPremise 5 states: \"All musicians performing at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra who are interesting soloists are capable of attracting audiences.\"\nTherefore, if Ryan is capable of attracting audiences, Ryan must be an interesting soloist.\n\nStep 2: If Ryan is an interesting soloist, does he have a temporary role at the orchestra?\nPremise 4 states: \"All musicians performing at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra who have temporary roles at the orchestra are interesting soloists.\"\nThis means if Ryan has a temporary role, he is automatically an interesting soloist.\nHowever, the statement does not tell us that all interesting soloists have temporary roles; there is no indication that permanent members cannot be interesting soloists. Therefore, it is possible (but unclear) that Ryan could be an interesting soloist without necessarily having a temporary role.\n\nStep 3: Checking other premises for Ryan's role:\n\nFrom Premise 2: \"A musician performing at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra is either a permanent member or has a temporary role.\"\nThus, Ryan must fall into one of these two categories: he is either a permanent member or has a temporary role.\n\nFrom Premise 1: \"No touring musicians who perform at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra are permanent members.\"\nAnd Premise 3: \"All touring musicians who perform at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra have temporary roles.\"\nIf Ryan is a touring musician, he cannot be a permanent member and must have a temporary role.\nHowever, if Ryan is not touring, it's possible for him to be a permanent member.\n\nStep 4: Consider Premise 7:\nPremise 7 adds: \"If Ryan is an interesting soloist and has a temporary role, then he is capable of attracting large audiences if and only if he is a touring soloist musician.\"\nThis doesn't directly help us determine whether he has a temporary role or not, but it reinforces the strong link between being interesting, having a temporary role, and attracting audiences.\n\nStep 5: Does being \"capable of attracting audiences\" imply a temporary role?\nFrom Premises 4 and 5, we know:\nTemporary role  $\\rightarrow$  Interesting soloist  $\\rightarrow$  Capable of attracting audiences.\nBut we do not know the reverse: whether being capable of attracting audiences requires having a temporary role.\nIf Ryan is permanently a part of an orchestra (as allowed by Premise 2), he could still be capable of attracting audiences if permanent members can also become interesting soloists. There is no explicit reason to rule this out.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe statement, \"If Ryan is capable of attracting audiences, then Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra\", is uncertain based on the given premises.\nThere is insufficient information to prove that capability to attract audiences is exclusively tied to having a temporary role.\nWhile the premises establish a strong link between temporary roles, interesting soloists, and audience attraction, they do not explicitly exclude permanent members from also being interesting soloists and attracting audiences.", "Math Expert Answer": "Premise 6 states that Ryan is a musician and performing at New Haven Symphony Orchestra. \n\nThen, since premise 2 states that 'musicians who perform at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra are permanent members of an orchestra or they have temporary roles at the orchestra', Ryan is a permanent member of an orchestra, or Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra. Hence, we discuss the following two cases.\n\nCase 1: Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra.\n\nFrom premise 4, since Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra, Ryan is an interesting soloist.\n\nThen, by premise 5, Ryan is capable of attracting audiences. \n\nBecause Ryan is an interesting soloist and has temporary roles at the orchestra, considering premise 7, we can get the information that Ryan is capable of attracting large audiences if and only Ryan he is a touring soloist musician. Since Ryan is capable of attracting audiences, Ryan must be a touring soloist musician.\n\nHence, from premise 1, since Ryan is a touring musician, Ryan is not a permanent member of the orchestra. \n\nThese clauses do not violate premise 2 and premise 3. As a result, this case can exist.\n\nIn this case, since Ryan is capable of attracting audiences and Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra, the statement 'If Ryan is capable of attracting audiences, then Ryan has temporary roles at the orchestra' is true.\n\nCase 2: Ryan does not have temporary roles at the orchestra.\n\nBy premise 2, Ryan must be a permanent member of an orchestra. \n\nFrom premise 1, Ryan can not be a touring musician.\n\nWe can not get any other in this case.

This doesn't directly relate to her excitement for Christmas or cookies yet but is important when reasoning about Santa.\n\nPremise 4:\nPeople who expect presents on Christmas morning are excited for it to be Christmas.\nThis means that expecting presents implies excitement for Christmas. If Mercy does not expect presents, she is not excited for Christmas (negating excitement). Excitement here depends specifically on the expectation of presents.\n\nPremise 5:\nIf people would be surprised to see Santa Claus in their house, then they don't leave out cookies on Christmas Eve.\nThis means Mercy leaves out cookies only if she would not be surprised to see Santa.

However:\nFrom Premise 6, Mercy does not simultaneously expect presents, believe in Santa Claus, and be excited for Christmas.\nSo, if Mercy believes in Santa Claus, she cannot satisfy all three conditions.\n\nStep 3: Is Mercy excited for Christmas?\n\nFrom Premise 4, excitement for Christmas depends on expecting presents.\nIf Mercy does not expect presents, she is not excited for Christmas.\nTherefore, if Mercy believes in Santa Claus but does not expect presents (to avoid contradicting Premise 6), she cannot be excited for Christmas.\n\nConclusion:\nIf Mercy leaves out cookies, she acts as though she believes in Santa Claus, but based on Premises 4 and 6, belief in Santa Claus does not guarantee excitement for Christmas (due to the lack of presents).

This means Robert must like Italy's hallmark desserts. Hence, Robert cannot resist Italian desserts.

food at home using recipes and online guides' true, false, or uncertain?\"\n\nStep 1: Restate and understand the problem logically\n\nWe need to analyze the truth value of the conditional statement:\n\"If Sam owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home, then Sam makes a lot of their own food at home using recipes and online guides.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement (if-then), so for it to be evaluated:\nIt will be false only if the premise (Sam owns a coffeemaker and blender) is true, but the conclusion (Sam makes his own food using recipes and online guides) is false.\nIn all other cases (e.g., the premise is false or both are true), the statement is true.\n\nStep 2: Go through the premises and Sam's situation\nLet's consider the relevant premises step by step and identify details about Sam.\n\nPremise 1: If people in this neighborhood visit a coffee shop regularly, then they are addicted to coffee.\nThis connects coffee shop visits to addiction but doesn't directly involve Sam's ownership of a coffeemaker/blender or food habits.\nHowever, we note that Sam's addiction to coffee might matter later.\n\nPremise 2: People in this neighborhood visit a coffee shop regularly OR order takeout at least once a day.\nThis establishes that people in this neighborhood must do at least one of two things: a) Visit coffee shops regularly, OR\nb) Order takeout at least once a day.\nWe'll track how this relates to Sam, particularly if he owns a coffeemaker/blender (Premise 4).\n\nPremise 3: If people in this neighborhood make a lot of their own food at home using recipes, THEN they order takeout at least once a day.\nMaking one's own food using recipes implies ordering takeout at least once a day.\nThus, if Sam makes his own food (the conclusion of the given conditional we're evaluating), we know he must also order takeout once a day.\n\nPremise 4: If people own at least one coffeemaker and one blender, THEN they do not order takeout at least once a day.\nIf Sam owns a coffeemaker and blender, this contradicts Premise 3:\nHe can't own a coffeemaker/blender and order takeout at least once a day.\n\nPremise 5: People with very busy lives (12-hour work hours) make a lot of their own food using recipes and online guides.\nIf Sam leads a very busy life, he must make a lot of his own food.\nThis means the conclusion of the given conditional (Sam makes his own food) holds if Sam is busy.\n\nPremise 6: Sam is either addicted to coffee and leads a busy life OR is not addicted and does not lead a busy life.\nThere are two cases for Sam:\nSam is addicted to coffee AND has a busy life (12-hour work hours).\nSam is not addicted to coffee AND does not have a busy life.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the given statement\n\nNow let's analyze the provided claim:\n\"If Sam owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home, then Sam makes a lot of their own food at home using recipes and online guides.\"\n\nCase-by-case analysis:\n\n1.If Sam owns a coffeemaker and blender:\nFrom Premise 4, this implies that Sam does not order takeout at least once a day.\nFrom Premise 3, if Sam makes his own food, then he must order takeout at least once a day.\nThus, Sam can't both own a coffeemaker/blender AND make his own food, as this would create a direct contradiction between Premises 3 and 4.\nTherefore, if Sam owns these appliances, the condition (Sam makes his own food) cannot be satisfied, making the given statement false if Sam owns them.\n\n2.If Sam does not own a coffeemaker and blender:\nIn this case, Premise 4 does not apply.\nIf Sam leads a busy life (from Premise 6, first scenario), then according to Premise 5, he makes his own food, satisfying the conclusion of the conditional statement.\nIf Sam does not lead a busy life (from Premise 6, second scenario), there's no reason to believe he makes his own food, but this doesn't make the conditional false since the premise (owning a coffeemaker/blender) is false in this case.\nTherefore, the statement would be true if Sam does not own these appliances.\n\nStep 4: Final conclusion\n\nThe truth value of the statement depends on whether Sam owns a coffeemaker and a blender:\nIf Sam owns them, the statement is false (as shown in Case 1).\nIf Sam does not own them, the statement is true (as shown in Case 2).\n\nThus, the overall answer is:\nUncertain, as we don't know whether Sam owns a coffeemaker and blender.", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 6, Sam is living in this neighborhood, and there are two cases for Sam: one is 'he is addicted to coffee or

hours'. We need to discuss them separately.\n\nCase 1: Sam is addicted to coffee or other caffeinated drinks and leads a very busy life that include 12-hour work hours.\n\nIn this case, since Sam is in this neighborhood, and leads a very busy life that include 12-hour work hours, by premise 5, Sam makes a lot of their own food at home using recipes and online guides. \n\nThen, from premise 3, Sam orders takeout at least once a day. \n\nSince premise 4 states that 'If people in this neighborhood own at least one coffeemaker and one blender in their home, then they do not order takeout at least once a day', and Sam orders takeout at least once a day, Sam can not own at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home.\n\nThe previous analysis is consistent with premise 1 and premise 2.

However, we don't yet know if Sam owns these appliances.\n\nStep 3: Is Sam addicted to coffee (or other caffeinated drinks) or not?\n\nFrom premise (6), we know Sam's situation can be divided into two possibilities:\n\n1.Sam is addicted to coffee (or other caffeinated drinks) and leads a busy 12-hour work life.\nIf this is true, by (5), Sam makes his own food, and by (3), he orders takeout at least once a day.\n\n2.Sam is NOT addicted to coffee and does NOT lead a very busy life.\nIf this is true, no clear conclusions can be drawn about his food-related habits or appliance ownership.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating possible scenarios for Sam owning appliances or ordering takeout:\nIf Sam owns both a coffeemaker and a blender, we know from (4) that he does not order takeout at least once a day.\nIf Sam does NOT own both appliances, we cannot definitively conclude his takeout habits from the premises alone.\n\nStep 5: Analyzing for the statement:\n\nThe statement reads:\n\"Sam either owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home OR does not order takeout at least once a day.\"\n\nThis is a logical disjunction (\"OR\"), meaning it is true if either of the following is true:\n\nSam owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender.\nSam does not order takeout at least once a day.\n\nFrom the analysis:\nIf Sam owns both appliances, the statement is true (no takeout daily).\nIf Sam does not own both appliances:\nIf Sam leads a 12-hour work life, he orders takeout daily (based on premises 3 and 5, making the second part false).\nIf Sam does NOT lead a 12-hour work life, his takeout habits remain uncertain (not specified in the premises).\n\nThus, without direct knowledge of Sam's appliance ownership or specific habits, the truth of this statement is uncertain, as it hinges on knowing whether Sam owns the appliances or not.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement \"Sam either owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home or does not order takeout at least once a day\" is UNCERTAIN, because there is insufficient information about whether Sam owns these appliances or his food/takeout habits if he does not lead a busy life.", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 6, Sam is living in this neighborhood, and there are two cases for Sam: one is 'he is addicted to coffee or other caffeinated drinks and leads a very busy life that include 12-hour work hours', and the other is 'he is not addicted to coffee and does not lead a very busy life that include 12-hour work hours'.

contemporary academic who enjoys learning, then Clyde is focused on futuristic and vocational subjects.\n\nStep 1: Logical Implications of Premise 6\n\nPremise 6 states:\nIf Clyde is not focused on futuristic and vocational subjects, then Clyde is neither focused on futuristic and vocational subjects nor enjoys dressing up.\nIf Clyde is not focused on futuristic and vocational subjects, then he also does not enjoy dressing up.\nThis means that Clyde cannot be both not focused on futuristic/vocational subjects and someone who enjoys dressing up.\nAdditionally, if Clyde is focused on futuristic and vocational subjects, then premise 4 implies that Clyde is a contemporary academic who enjoys learning.\n\nStep 2: Contrapositive of Premise 4\n\nPremise 4 states:\nIf someone is focused on futuristic and vocational subjects, then they are contemporary academics who enjoy learning.\nTaking the contrapositive:\nIf someone is NOT a contemporary academic who enjoys learning, then they are NOT focused on futuristic and vocational subjects.\n\nStep 3: Contradiction with the Question\n\nThe question asks us to evaluate:\nIf Clyde is not a contemporary academic who enjoys learning, then Clyde is focused on futuristic and vocational subjects.\n\nFrom Step 2 above, the contrapositive of Premise 4 tells us that if someone is NOT a contemporary academic who enjoys learning, then they are also NOT focused on futuristic and vocational subjects.\nThis directly contradicts the question's statement. Therefore, the statement in the question is false.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement \"If Clyde is not a contemporary academic who enjoys learning, then Clyde is focused on futuristic and vocational subjects\" is false, because it contradicts the logical implications of Premise 4.

Case 1: Kat works well in teams (A) and is always tired every morning (D).\n2. Case 2: Kat does not work well in teams ( $\\lnot$ A) and is not always tired every morning ( $\\lnot$ D).\nNo other possibility for Kat exists.\n\nStep 3: Connecting Premises and Kat's feedback\n\nLet's determine whether Kat can receive positive feedback (F) in either case:\n\nCase 1: Kat works well in teams (A) and is always tired every morning (D):\nBy Premise 1 (A $\\rightarrow$ B): Since Kat works well in teams (A), she gets along with all her colleagues (B).\nFrom Premise 4 (D $\\rightarrow$ E): Since Kat is always tired every morning (D), she is criticized by her boss (E).\nFrom Premise 5 (E $\\rightarrow$  $\\lnot$ F): Since Kat is criticized by her boss (E), she does not receive positive feedback from her teams ( $\\lnot$ F).\nThus, in Case 1, Kat does not receive positive feedback ( $\\lnot$ F).\n\nCase 2: Kat does not work well in teams ( $\\lnot$ A) and is not always tired every morning ( $\\lnot$ D):\nBy Premise 4 (D $\\rightarrow$ E): Since Kat is not always tired ( $\\lnot$ D), Premise 4 does not apply, and there is no guarantee she is criticized by her boss. However, nothing else in the premises guarantees positive feedback (F), and Premises 1-5 do not establish that Kat receives feedback (F) without working well in teams (A).\nThus, in Case 2, there is no evidence Kat receives positive feedback (F).\n\nStep 4: Evaluating the statement F $\\rightarrow$ D\n\nTo evaluate the truth of F $\\rightarrow$ D (\"If Kat receives positive feedback, then Kat is always tired in the morning\"), we consider what happens when F is true.\nFrom both Case 1 and Case 2, we determined Kat does not receive positive feedback ( $\\lnot$ F).\nIn logic, an implication F $\\rightarrow$ D is true whenever F is false, regardless of the truth value of D.\nTherefore, the statement F $\\rightarrow$ D is true.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statement \"If Kat receives positive feedback from teams at work, then Kat is always tired in the morning.\" is true based on the premises. This is because Kat does not receive positive feedback ( $\\lnot$ F), making the implication F $\\rightarrow$ D vacuously true.", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 6, there are two statuses for Kat: either Kat is a person who works well in teams in the workplace and is always tired every morning, or neither.

Thus, by premise 5, Kat does not receive positive feedback from teams at work.\n\nPremise 3 states that people either come to work every day with a positive attitude or are always tired every morning. Then, because Kat is always tired every morning, Kat can not come to work every day with a positive attitude.\n\nCase 2:  Kat is not a person who works well in teams in the workplace and is not always tired every morning.\n\nSince Kat is not a person who works well in teams in the workplace, from premise 2, Kat does not come to work every day with a positive attitude.\n\nHowever, Kat is not always tired every morning and does not come to work every day with a positive attitude, contradicting premise 3 'People either come to work every day with a positive attitude or are always tired every morning.'.

Therefore, adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer.\nThis point aligns with premise 5, which states that all non-prostate cancers are cancers, and adenocarcinoma would fall under the umbrella of non-prostate cancers.\n\nStep 2: Does adenocarcinoma involve mutations?\nFrom premise 4, all cancers involve mutations. Since adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, it necessarily involves mutations.\n\nStep 3: Does adenocarcinoma affect females?\nFrom premise 6, if adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer (which it is, as shown in Step 1), then adenocarcinoma must occur in women or involve no mutations or both.\n\nHowever:\nAdenocarcinoma does involve mutations (from Step 2), so the \"without mutations\" part of premise 6 is false.\nTherefore, adenocarcinoma must occur in women to satisfy premise 6.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating the Statement\n\nThe statement claims:\n\"Adenocarcinoma affects females or it is not a type of cancer.\"\n\nFrom our reasoning, adenocarcinoma does affect females (as derived in Step 3) and is already determined to be a type of cancer (Step 1).\nSince the first part of the statement (\"Adenocarcinoma affects females\") is true, the disjunction (\"or\") in the statement makes the whole statement true, regardless of the second part.\n\nConclusion\nThe statement \"Adenocarcinoma affects females or it is not a type of cancer\" is TRUE, based on the provided premises and logical evaluation.\n\nThis conclusion is primarily due to premise 6, which necessitates that adenocarcinoma, as a type of cancer, must either involve no mutations (which it does not) or occur in women (which it must).", "Math Expert Answer": "Premise 3 states that anything is either prostate cancer or non-prostate cancer.

Thus, from Premises 4 and 3, if grapes are fruit, they must be edible and therefore food.\nPremise 1 creates a contradiction: grass is not food, so grapes cannot simultaneously be grass and food.\nThis logical contradiction implies grapes cannot be meadows, because if they were, they would necessarily be grass, which rules out them being food or edible.\n\nStep 3: Check for any uncertainties.\n\nAll of the premises are consistent except for the possible ambiguity in Premise 6, which states, \"Grapes are not both edible and lemons.\" This leaves open the possibility that grapes might be neither edible nor lemons.

Therefore, grapes would not fall into the category of fruit.\n\nEven if grapes were not edible, they still could not be meadows because \"meadows are grass,\" and grass cannot overlap with food (from Premise 1).\n\nConclusion:\nThe statement \"Grapes are meadows\" is false, because it leads to a logical contradiction with the premises that grass is not food and that grapes are food (if considered fruit).

then Mark is not studying to go to medical school.\n\nWe now need to analyze Mark's situation based on the other premises.\n\nWhat do we know about Mark?\nLet's analyze the premises linked to medical school:\n\n1.Premises 4 and 3 state:\nIf Mark grew up with parents who were doctors  $\\rightarrow$  Mark enjoys healthcare  $\\rightarrow$  Mark is studying to go to medical school.\n\n2.Premise 5 tells us:\nIf Mark studies hard  $\\rightarrow$  Mark grew up with parents who were doctors.\n\n3.Premise 7 states:\nIf Mark neither enjoys healthcare nor grew up with parents who were doctors, then Mark studies hard or grew up with parents who were doctors.\n\nBreaking it down into specific cases:\n\nCase 1: Mark grew up with parents who were doctors.\nIf this is true, then (from premise 4), Mark enjoys healthcare and (from premise 3) Mark is studying medicine.\nIf Mark is studying medicine, then (from premise 1), Mark cannot practice coding questions.\nAnd (from premise 2), if Mark does not practice coding questions, Mark cannot want to work in the software engineering industry.\nThus, in this case, Mark does not want to work in the software engineering industry.\n\nCase 2: Mark did not grow up with parents who were doctors.\nIn this case, Mark's enjoyment of healthcare and decision to study medicine depend on other factors.\n\nLet's consider premise 7:\nIf Mark does not enjoy healthcare fields and did not grow up with doctor parents, then Mark must either study hard or have doctor parents. Since Mark does not have doctor parents, Mark must study hard.\nIf Mark studies hard, then (from premise 5), Mark must have had doctor parents, which creates a contradiction.\n\nThus, in this scenario, Mark cannot simultaneously study hard and not have doctor parents.

Let us examine the possibilities for Thomas's characteristics.\n\nKey Observations:\nFrom Premises 2 and 5, since Thomas works at Jess's company, he must fall into one of two categories: \"miserly and needs to save\" or \"frivolously spends.\"\n\nFrom Premise 7: If Thomas is miserly (M), then he cannot value quality and luxury (Q), or if Q is true, then Thomas cannot be miserly. Thus, Q and M cannot both hold at the same time.\n\nFrom Premise 3: If Thomas frivolously spends, then he values quality and luxury (F $\\rightarrow$ Q).\n\nFrom Premise 6: If Thomas is not miserly ( $\\lnot$ M), then Thomas does not value quality and luxury ( $\\lnot$ Q). Combining this with F $\\rightarrow$ Q:\nIf Q is false (from  $\\lnot$ M), then F must also be false. Therefore,  $\\lnot$ M $\\rightarrow$  $\\lnot$ F.\n\nConnecting Thomas to Spa-Going:\nFrom Premise 1, people at Jess's company who go to the spa frequently are not miserly (Spa-goer $\\rightarrow$  $\\lnot$ M). Thus, a person who is miserly will not go to the spa frequently.\nIf Thomas goes to the spa frequently (Spa-Thomas), then Thomas is not miserly ( $\\lnot$ M). From Premise 6, this would also mean Q (values quality and luxury) is false for Thomas.\n\n3. Evaluating the Conditional Statement\n\nThe statement to evaluate is:\n(If Thomas is an astronaut) $\\rightarrow$ (Thomas is a spa-goer).\n\nThis is a logical implication (P $\\rightarrow$ Q): it is true unless the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nThe problem gives no information about whether Thomas is an astronaut. Thus, the antecedent (P) is uncertain. In logic, when the antecedent of an implication is unknown or false, the entire implication is true.\nWhether Thomas goes to the spa frequently or not depends only on his miserly/frivolous status and not on being an astronaut (no direct connection in premises between \"astronaut\" and \"spa-goer\"). However, since no contradictory information is provided, the implication P $\\rightarrow$ Q holds.\n\n4. Final Answer\nThe statement \"If Thomas is an astronaut, then Thomas is a person who goes to the spa frequently.\" is true.\n\nThis follows because a conditional statement is true whenever the antecedent (Thomas being an astronaut) is not definitively true while the consequent (Thomas being a spa-goer) is not definitively false.", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 5, we know that Thomas works at Jess's company.\n\nTo analyze the statement, let's start the analysis from premise 2, which states that 'people who work at Jess's company are either miserly and need to save a large portion of their income, or frivolously spend a lot of money'. Thus, two cases need to be discussed from premise 2.\n\nCase 1: Thomas is not both miserly and needs to save a large portion of his income, but frivolously spends a lot of money.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent of premise 6 is satisfied. Hence, Thomas does not value quality manufacturing and luxury items.\nBy premise 3, since Thomas works at Jess's company and frivolously spends a lot of money, Thomas values quality manufacturing and luxury items, which is contrary to the previous conclusion from premise 6.\n\nTherefore, this case is impossible to exist.\n\nCase 2: Thomas is miserly and needs to save a large portion of his income, but does not frivolously spend a lot of money.\n\nIn this case, 'Thomas is miserly and need to save a large portion of his income' is consistent with premise 6.\nSince Thomas is miserly, by premise 7, Thomas values quality manufacturing and luxury items.\nThen, by premise 4, Thomas enjoys shopping for materialistic items in his free time. \nSince Thomas is miserly and need to save a large portion of his income, by premise 1, Thomas can not be a person who goes to the spa frequently.\nSince Thomas does not frivolously spend a lot of money, premise 3 does not apply to this case.\n\nThus, the assumptions are consistent with all the given premises, which makes case 2 possible to occur.\n\nSince case 1 can not exist, only case 2 can occur. \n\nThus, Thomas is miserly and needs to save a large portion of his income, values quality manufacturing and luxury items, enjoys shopping for materialistic items in his free time, and can not be a person who goes to the spa frequently.\n\nNow let's analyze the statement 'If Thomas is an astronaut, then Thomas is a person who goes to the spa frequently'.\n\nIf Thomas is an astronaut, then the statement 'Thomas is a person who goes to the spa frequently' is false, since we already know that Thomas can not be a person who goes to the spa frequently.\n\nAs a result, the statement 'If Thomas is an astronaut, then Thomas is a person who goes to the spa frequently' is false."}, {"Story id": 392, "Example id": 10075, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": true, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "wrong", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": [], "Conclusion": "Two is a prime number or a natural number.", "Premises": ["All prime numbers are natural numbers.", "All integers are real numbers.", "All real numbers are complex numbers.", "One is a prime number or a natural number or both.", "If one is not a complex number, then one is a prime number and an integer."], "Label": "Uncertain", "GPT-4o Answer": "To determine whether the statement \"Two is a prime number or a natural number\" is true or false or uncertain, let's systematically review the given premises.\n\nPremise 1: All prime numbers are natural numbers.\nThis tells us that if a number is prime, it is automatically categorized as a natural number.\n\nPremise 2: All integers are real numbers.\nEvery integer belongs to the set of real numbers.

It must be either:\nUsed for lectures and office hours simultaneously, or\nNot used at all (neither for lectures nor for office hours).\n\nTherefore, Room 116 cannot be used only for lectures or only for office hours.\n\n2.What happens if Room 116 is used for office hours?\n\nFrom premise 5, if Room 116 is used for office hours, then it must also be booked in the evening.\nFrom premise 6, if Room 116 is used for office hours, then it must also be used for lectures (simultaneously).\nThus: If Room 116 is used for office hours, it is also used for lectures and is booked during the day (by premise 1).\n\n3.What happens if Room 116 is booked during the day?\n\nFrom premise 1, if Room 116 is booked during the day, it must be used for lectures.\nFrom premise 6, if Room 116 is used for lectures, it must also be used for office hours.\nThus: If Room 116 is booked during the day, it is used for both lectures and office hours.\n\n4.What does the antecedent (\"Room 116 is either used for office hours or booked during the day\") imply?\n\nBased on the above points, if Room 116 is either:\nUsed for office hours  $\\rightarrow$  It must also be used for lectures (and booked during the day).\nBooked during the day  $\\rightarrow$  It must also be used for lectures (and office hours).\nIn either case, Room 116 is used for lectures.\n\n5.What does the consequent (\"Room 116 is not used for lectures\") state?\n\nThe consequent directly contradicts the findings above.

Taylor both is highly acclaimed in her profession and often holds tenured or high-ranking positions.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nPremise 7 and Taylor\nPremise 7 states: It is not true that Taylor both holds highly acclaimed status in her profession and often holds tenured or high-ranking positions.\nThis explicitly denies the combination of highly acclaimed and \"tenured/high-ranking positions.\"\nThis does not rule out the possibility that Taylor is highly acclaimed but doesn't hold tenured positions, or that Taylor doesn't hold either attribute.\n\nBeing \"Highly Acclaimed\" Implies Receiving Feedback/Recommendations\nFrom Premise 5: Emily's friends who are highly acclaimed in their profession often receive glowing feedback/recommendations.\nBut there is no direct evidence Taylor specifically is highly acclaimed, only that Premise 7 denies a specific combination related to Taylor's status.\n\nEvaluation of Taylor's Status\n\nWe need to determine whether Emily's friends in general often receive glowing feedback:\n\nEmily's friends must belong to one of two groups (Premise 3):\nWork in the entertainment industry, or\nAre highly acclaimed in their profession.\n\nTaylor is Emily's friend, so she fits into one of these two categories.\n\nIf Taylor belongs to Group (2) (highly acclaimed), then by Premise 5 she would often receive glowing feedback and recommendations.\n\nIf Taylor belongs to Group (1) (work in entertainment), Premise 1 prevents her from publishing journals (but doesn't conflict with glowing feedback).\n\nVerifying the Claim\nThe statement is general: \"One of Emily's friends often receives glowing feedback.\"\nEven if Taylor's specific status is uncertain (highly acclaimed vs. entertainment industry), Premise 5 clearly states that highly acclaimed friends often receive glowing feedback.\nBecause at least some of Emily's friends are highly acclaimed (given that they must fit into one of the two groups in Premise 3), it follows that at least one friend often receives glowing feedback.\n\nConclusion\nThe statement \"One of Emily's friends often receives glowing feedback and recommendations from their colleagues\" is true.\n\nWhy?\nPremise 5 guarantees that being highly acclaimed often brings glowing feedback.\nPremise 3 ensures some of Emily's friends are highly acclaimed, so it is true that at least one of them often receives glowing feedback.", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the status of Taylor, we start with premise 7. \n\nPremise 7 indicates that Taylor does not meet both conditions of being highly

then they often hold tenured and high-ranking positions at their workplace'. Thus, according to this premise 4, since Taylor is Emily's friend by premise 6, if Taylor is highly acclaimed in her profession, then she both is highly acclaimed in her profession and often holds tenured and high-ranking positions at her workplace, which conflicts with premise 7. Thus, Taylor can not be highly acclaimed in her profession.\n\nThen, from premise 3, since Taylor is Emily's friend and is not highly acclaimed in her profession, Taylor must work in the entertainment industry.\nThen, according to premise 1, Taylor does not publish journals.\nAccording to premise 2, since Taylor does not publish journals, Taylor is not an award-winning novelist.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, we know that Taylor is Emily's friend (from premise 6), and is not highly acclaimed in her profession.\n\nThe only premise related to \"often receive glowing feedback and recommendations from their colleagues\" is premise 5, which states that \"If Emily's friends are highly acclaimed in their profession, then they often receive glowing feedback and recommendations from their colleagues\".

It might not be managed by Yale Housing.\nAdditionally, being on York Street opens the possibility that Harkness was built before 1701, as Premise 4 does not apply to buildings off-campus.\n\nSummary: If Harkness is located on York Street, it may neither be managed by Yale Housing nor built after 1701.\n\nThis satisfies the second part of the statement: \"Neither managed by Yale Housing nor built after 1701.\"\n\nTruth of the Statement\nThe statement says: \"Harkness is either both managed by Yale Housing and built after 1701, or neither.\"\n\nCase 1 (operated by Yale Housing staff): Harkness is both managed by Yale Housing and built after 1701.\nCase 2 (located on York Street): Harkness is neither managed by Yale Housing nor built after 1701.\n\nIn either case, the statement is true.\n\nConclusion\nThe statement \"Harkness is either both managed by Yale Housing and built after 1701, or neither\" is true, based on the given premises.", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 6 'Harkness is either managed by Yale Housing or built after 1701', there are two cases for Harkness.\n\nCase 1: Harkness is a Yale building operated by Yale Housing staff, but it is not located on York Street.\n\nPremise 3 states that all Yale buildings operated by Yale Housing staff are managed by Yale Housing. Hence, since Harkness is a Yale building operated by Yale Housing staff, it is managed by Yale Housing.\nThen, according to premise 2 \"All Yale buildings managed by Yale Housing are dormitories.\", Harkness is a dormitory. \nAccording to premise 1 \"All Yale dormitories are located on the Yale campus.\", Harkness is located on the Yale campus.

This inconsistency means some premises cannot all simultaneously hold true.\n\nFor the sake of logical evaluation, let's proceed with the explicit conditional relationships provided in the question, assuming we hold the premises true individually where applicable.\n\nDeduction 2: Things that are not satellites of the Earth have pandas\nFrom premise (6), if the Moon is not a satellite of the Earth, it must have pandas on it.\nContrapositive: If there are no pandas on the Moon, then the Moon must be a satellite of the Earth.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the statement\nStatement: \"If there are no pandas on the Moon, then the Moon does not orbit the Earth.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form if P, then Q, where:\nP = \"There are no pandas on the Moon.\"\nQ = \"The Moon does not orbit the Earth.\"\n\nTesting the statement with the premises:\nFrom Deduction 2: If the Moon does not have pandas, it must be a satellite of the Earth.\nThis directly contradicts the conclusion (Q) that \"The Moon does not orbit the Earth.\"\nIn this case, if there are no pandas, the Moon must orbit the Earth, making the statement false.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nThe statement \"If there are no pandas on the Moon, then the Moon does not orbit the Earth\" is false.\n\nReasoning:\nFrom premise (6), the lack of pandas implies the Moon is a satellite of the Earth (orbits it), directly contradicting the claim made in the statement.\n\nSummary of Key Points\nPremises 3, 4, and 5 introduce logical inconsistencies, but focusing on premise (6), a direct relationship is established between \"not having pandas\" and \"being a satellite of the Earth.\"\nThe conditional statement is evaluated as false because its conclusion contradicts the logical consequences of premise (6).", "Math Expert Answer": "From premise 1, we know that the Moon is a planet.\n\nThen, by premise 2 (A planet either orbits the Earth, or it is not a satellite of the Earth), there are two cases for the Moon.\n\nCase 1: The Moon orbits the Earth, and it is a satellite of the Earth.\n\nIn this case, since the Moon orbits the Earth, by premise 3 (Anything that orbits the Earth is round), it is round.\nThen, by premise 4 (Round things all emit light), the Moon emits light.\nSince the Moon is a planet and is a satellite of the Earth (from the assumption of case 1), by premise 5 (Planets that are satellites of the Earth do not emit light), it does not emit light, which conflicts with the result of premise 4.\n\nThus, case 1 is impossible to exist.\n\nCase 2: The Moon does not orbit the Earth, and it is not a satellite of the Earth.\n\nThe assumption of case 2 is compatible with premises 3,4, and 5. \nFrom premise 6 (Things that are not satellites of the Earth have pandas on them), since the Moon is not a satellite of the Earth, there are some pandas on it.\n\nBecause case 1 can not exist, only case 2 exists. \nThus, the Moon does not orbit the Earth, it is not a satellite of the Earth, and there are some pandas on it.\n\nHence, the antecedent of the conditional statement \"If there are no pandas on the Moon\" can not be satisfied.\n\nAs a result, the conditional statement 'If there are no pandas on the Moon, then the Moon does not orbit the Earth' is vacuously true."}, {"Story id": 1002, "Example id": 20004, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": false, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "wrong", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": [], "Conclusion": "Bottled water is produced by Google.", "Premises": ["Fanta is a kind of drink.", "Each kind of drink is produced and only produced by one of the following three companies: Coca, Pepsi, and Google.", "Anything produced by Coca is either bottled or sweet.", "Sweet things are produced by Pepsi.", "Bottled things are all produced by Google or Pepsi.", "Google produces bottled drinks.", "Water is a kind of drink."], "Label": "Uncertain", "GPT-4o Answer": "The statement \"Bottled water is produced by Google\" is true, based on the given premises.

Application of Premises Step-by-Step\nA) The 5th Guard Corps is organized by Ash.\nFrom premise (1): Every corps organized by Ash does not have an engineering company.\nThis means the 5th Guard Corps does not have an engineering company.\n\nB) The 5th Guard Corps does not have an engineering company.\nFrom premise (2): A corps without an engineering company will not cross the river.\nThis means the 5th Guard Corps cannot break out by crossing the river.\n\nC) The 5th Guard Corps is surrounded and has close air support.\nFrom premise (3): Since the corps is surrounded, it must break out in one of two ways:\nBy crossing the river, or\nBy crossing the mountain.\nHowever, we already established (from premise 2) that the 5th Guard Corps cannot cross the river because it does not have an engineering company.\n\nD) If a corps is surrounded and has close air support, it will break out by crossing the mountain.\nFrom premise (4): If a surrounded corps has close air support, it will break out by crossing the mountain.\nSince the 5th Guard Corps is surrounded and has close air support, it will necessarily break out by crossing the mountain.\n\nE) Confirming it isn't a tank corps.\nPremise (5): No tank corps crosses the mountain.\nWe are not told that the 5th Guard Corps is a tank corps, so this premise does not restrict its ability to cross the mountain.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe 5th Guard Corps meets all the conditions outlined in the statement:\nIt is a corps.\nIt has close air support.\nIt is organized by Ash.\n\nBased on the premises, it must break out by crossing the mountain. Hence, the statement is TRUE.\n\nSummary\nPremises confirm that any corps organized by Ash cannot cross a river.\nA surrounded corps with close air support will necessarily break out by crossing the mountain.\nThe 5th Guard Corps satisfies all the conditions required to break out by crossing the mountain.\n\nThus, the statement is TRUE.", "Math Expert Answer": "To evaluate the statement 'If the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash, then it will break out by crossing the mountain', we first assume that the antecedent of the statement is correct, and then find if there is a contradiction.\n\nAssume that the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash.\n\nPremises 6,7,8 are irrelevant to the 5th Guard Corps.\n\nSince the 5th Guard Corps is a corps and is organized by Ash, by premise 1, it does not have an engineering company.\nThen, by premise 2, the 5th Guard Corps will not cross the river.\nHence, there are no contradictions when we only assume that the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash.\n\nThen we consider whether the consequent could be true.\n\nCase 1: The antecedent 'If the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash' holds, and the statement is true.\n\nHence, the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash, and it will break out by crossing the mountain.\nThen, by premise 5, the 5th Guard Corps is not a tank corps.\nThe premises 3 and 4 are consistent with 'the 5th Guard Corps will break out by crossing the mountain'.\n\nTherefore, case 1 can exist.\n\nCase 2: The antecedent 'If the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash' holds, and the statement is false.\n\nHence, the 5th Guard Corps is a corps, has close air support and is organized by Ash, and it will not break out by crossing the mountain.\nThen, by premise 4, the 5th Guard Corps is not surrounded.

Thus, B cannot be a liar in this case.\n\nFinally, consider C's statement (\"There are exactly two truth-tellers.\").\nIf C is truthful (T), then A and B are truth-tellers, but we already assumed C is a liar, so this case is inconsistent.\n\nThus, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\nCase 2: Assume A is a liar (L).\n\nIf A is lying, then the statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar\" is false.\nFor this conditional (If B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar) to be false:\nB must be a truth-teller (T), and\nC must be a truth-teller (T) (violating the \"then\" part of the conditional).\n\nNow consider B's statement (\"At least one of A and C is a liar\").\nIf B is truthful (T), then at least one of A or C must be a liar. This is consistent because A is a liar (L).\nIf B is lying (L), it would mean that neither A nor C is a liar, which is inconsistent with our assumption that A is a liar.\n\nFinally, consider C's statement (\"There are exactly two truth-tellers.\").\nIf C is truthful (T), then A is a liar and B, C both are truth-tellers. This satisfies C's statement.\nThus, this scenario is consistent.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\nIf A is a liar, the conditions are consistent with all the given statements.\nIf A is a truth-teller, we run into contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"A is a liar\" is TRUE.", "Math Expert Answer": "Because no premise directly shows who the truth-teller is, we need to discuss the possible cases separately.\n\nCase 1: A is a truth-teller, and B is a truth-teller.\n\nHence, since A is a truth-teller, what A says must be true (premise 1). Premise 2 shows that A says, if B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar. Since B is a truth-teller, C is a liar.\nThus, there are exactly two truth-tellers in A,B,C (A and B), which means that what C says (premise 4) is true. Thus, C is a truth-teller.\nHence, C is both a liar and a truth-teller, which conflicts with premise 1.\n\nTherefore, case 1 is impossible to exist.\n\nCase 2: A is a liar, and B is a truth-teller.\n\nSince A is a liar, what A says must be false. \nPremise 2 shows that A says 'if B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar'. Hence, since B is a truth-teller, to make what A says be false, C must be a truth-teller.\nPremise 3 shows that B says 'At least one of A and C is a liar'. Since A is a liar, what B says is correct, which means that B is a truth-teller. Hence, this premise is consistent with the assumption of this case.\nPremise 4 shows that C says 'There are exactly two truth-tellers in A,B,C'. Since A is a liar, B is a truth-teller, and C is a truth-teller, what C says is correct, which is consistent with that C is a truth-teller.\n\nBecause all the premises are consistent with the analysis of case 2, case 2 is possible to exist.\n\nCase 3: A is a truth-teller, and B is a liar.\n\nSince A is a truth-teller, what A says must be true (premise 1). Premise 2 shows that A says, if B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar. Since B is a liar, what A says is vacuously true.\nPremise 3 shows that B says 'At least one of A and C is a liar'. Since B is a liar, what B says is false, which means that A and C are both truth-tellers.\nPremise 4 shows that C says 'There are exactly two truth-tellers in A,B,C'. Since A is a truth-teller, B is a liar, and C is a truth-teller, what C says is correct, which is consistent with that C is a truth-teller.\n\nAll the premises are consistent with the analysis of case 3. Thus, case 3 is possible to exist.\n\nCase 4: A is a liar, and B is a liar.\n\nSince A is a liar, what A says must be false. \nPremise 2 shows that A says 'if B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar'. Since B is a liar, what A says is vacuously true, which conflicts with that A is a liar who always lies (premise 1).\n\nTherefore, case 4 can not exist.\n\nPutting all the cases together, we can find that only cases 2 and 3 can exist. \n\nFrom the analysis, A is a liar in case 2, but A is a truth-teller in case 3.\nTherefore, the truth of the statement 'A is a liar' is uncertain."}, {"Story id": 1012, "Example id": 20035, "If simple reasoning": false, "If case discussion": true, "If subcase conflict": true, "GPT-4o Label correctness": "wrong", "GPT-4o Answer correctness": "wrong", "Evaluation of original FOLIO example": [], "Conclusion": "It is not true that there is exactly one truth-teller in A and B.", "Premises": ["Each of A,B,C is either a truth-teller who always tells the truth or a liar who always lies.", "A says that 'If B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar'.", "B says that 'At least one of A and C is a liar'.", "C says that 'There are exactly two truth-tellers in A,B,C'."], "Label": "False", "GPT-4o Answer": "Answer: The statement 'It is not true that there is exactly one truth-teller in A and B.' is true.\n\nReasoning:\nWe need to analyze the given problem systematically, step by step, while considering all the premises and logical implications.\n\nKey Premises:\n1.Each of A, B, and C is either a truth-teller (always tells the truth) or a liar (always lies).\n2.A says: 'If B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.'\n3.B says: 'At least one of A and C is a liar.'\n4.C says: 'There are exactly two truth-tellers in A, B, C.'\nThe task is to evaluate whether the statement 'It is not true that there is exactly one truth-teller in A and B.' is true, false, or uncertain.\n\nStep 1: Deduce the possible truth-teller configuration.\nLet's explore possibilities based on the truth-teller/liar combinations.\n\nCase 1: Assume C is a truth-teller.\nIf C is a truth-teller, then C's statement 'There are exactly two truth-tellers in A, B, and C' is true.\nThis means exactly one of A and B is a truth-teller (since C is the second truth-teller).\n\nNow, we analyze A's and B's statements under this assumption:\nA says 'If B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.'\nC is already assumed to be a truth-teller, so this statement cannot be true if B is also a truth-teller.

Therefore, A could be a truth-teller or a liar depending on B.\nB says 'At least one of A and C is a liar.'\nC is a liar (assumed), so this statement is always true, which means B is a truth-teller.\n\nThus, under this configuration:\nB is a truth-teller, C is a liar, and A's role depends on the logical outcomes.\n\nHowever, it is clear that at least one of A and B must be a truth-teller.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the statement: 'It is not true that there is exactly one truth-teller in A and B.'\nFrom the analysis above, it is impossible for exactly one of A and B to be a truth-teller:\nIf C is a truth-teller, then exactly one of A and B is a truth-teller (B).\nIf C is a liar, then either both A and B are liars or one is a truth-teller (B).\nThus, the statement 'It is not true that there is exactly one truth-teller in A and B.' is true.\n\nSummary:\nThe key lies in analyzing C's statement and deducing configurations where the truth-teller count matches the premises.\nIt is impossible for there to be exactly one truth-teller in A and B under the given premises.\nTherefore, the statement 'It is not true that there is exactly one truth-teller in A and B.' is true.", "Math Expert Answer": "Because no premise directly shows who the truth-teller is, we need to discuss the possible cases separately.\n\nCase 1: A is a truth-teller, and B is a truth-teller.\n\nHence, since A is a truth-teller, what A says must be true (premise 1). Premise 2 shows that A says, if B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar. Since B is a truth-teller, C is a liar.\nThus, there are exactly two truth-tellers in A,B,C (A and B), which means that what C says (premise 4) is true. Thus, C is a truth-teller.\nHence, C is both a liar and a truth-teller, which conflicts with premise 1.\n\nTherefore, case 1 is impossible to exist.\n\nCase 2: A is a liar, and B is a truth-teller.\n\nSince A is a liar, what A says must be false. \nPremise 2 shows that A says 'if B is a truth-teller, then C is a liar'. Hence, since B is a truth-teller, to make what A says be false, C must be a truth-teller.\nPremise 3 shows that B says 'At least one of A and C is a liar'. Since A is a liar, what B says is correct, which means that B is a truth-teller. Hence, this premise is consistent with the assumption of this case.\nPremise 4 shows that C says 'There are exactly two truth-tellers in A,B,C'.

Since B is a liar, what A says is vacuously true, which conflicts with that A is a liar who always lies (premise 1).\n\nTherefore, case 4 can not exist.\n\nPutting all the cases together, we can find that only cases 2 and 3 can exist. \n\nIn case 2, A is a liar, and B is a truth-teller. Then, by premise 1, A is not a truth-teller.\nIn case 3, A is a truth-teller, and B is a liar.
